# hidden-panel
A better discord theme that hides all panels (member list, channel list, server list,...) except the chat panel. 

I created this in a short period (< 1h). I didn't research much into discord CSS so don't expect anything fancy.

## Use cases
I find this theme useful when I need to read discord messages and work on another window without splitting the screen or use a second monitor. Resize the discord window and make it top-most by [this tool](https://www.sordum.org/9182/window-topmost-control-v1-2/)

## Installation
I am too lazy to create releases, so copy the content of `HiddenPanels.theme.css` and put them in your theme folder
